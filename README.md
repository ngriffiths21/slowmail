# Slow Mail

Slow Mail is minimalist email with some funny core features:

* It is delivered in batches, so it only arrives once per day
* Sent mail is not saved
* Only one recipient is allowed, and one mail per day to each recipient.
* Mail is organized as a single thread back and forth between two people, and it is encouraged (possibly required) to wait for a response before sending another one.

The goal is to mimic the best features of letters and discourage the annoying parts of email.
