# Slow Mail

Slow Mail is minimalist email with some funny core features:

* It is delivered in batches and only arrives once per day
* Sent mail is not saved
* Only one recipient is allowed
* Mailboxes can only display the latest mail from each sender

The goal is to mimic the best features of letters and discourage the annoying parts of email.
